# Graphics Application

- A Qt-based application that implements all basic graphics algorithms.

## Brief Overview:

- `Line Drawing Algorithms`: DDA, Bressenham algorithms.
- `Circle Drawing Algorithms`: Polar, Bressenham algorithms.
- `Ellipse Drawing Algorithms`: Polar, Bressenham Mid-point algorithms.
- `Filling Algorithms`: Scan-line Fill, Flood Fill, Boundary Fill algorithms.
- `Transformation Algorithms`: Shift, Scale, Shear, Rotate, etc.
- `Clipping`: Line and Polygon clipping algorithms.
